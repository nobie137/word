# word
Fun little C thing I wrote that just prints out random words, Alternatively you can talk to God using this.
There is a default wordlist included but you can generate your own with [genwordlist.sh](https://github.com/nobie137/word/blob/main/genwordlist.sh) if you feel like it. Just provide a word list divided by newlines. The script prints it out instead of making a file so just do something like:
```
./genwordlist.sh wordlist.txt > wordlist.h
```
